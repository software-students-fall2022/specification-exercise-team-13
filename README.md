# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Stakeholders

### App Owner
Information consolidated from interviews with two NYU students.

#### Needs
- A measure of success calculated by surveying students utilizing the app and its helpfulness in their matriculation.
- A consolidated place for professor or class ratings, class options, and degree progress.
- A means to compare course options to one another.
- A clear picture of different hurdles that might prevent someone from registering for a class (such as seasonality of a course or pre-requisites).

#### Problems
- Difficulty navigating the current set up of course registration.
- Degree guidelines and possible paths are not highlighted enough to the average student.
- Information regarding course options are typically vague.
- Many students have similar complaints about the registration system and its navigation. This is a clear problem for an untapped market.

### End Users
Information consolidated from interviews with five NYU students.

#### Needs
- Students value high professor ratings.
- Students consider the time of course when making a scheduling decision.
- Graduation requirements need to be highlighted better.
- Students want to understand what a course really teaches, and how it is structured before enrolling.

#### Problems
- The interface of the registration system is confusing.
- Course selection is confusing/ tedious and over complicated.
- The registration time slot is inconvenient and difficult to remember.
- Course description is not very descriptive and useful in determining if the course is something they would like to take.

## Product Vision Statement

Build an app to clearly outline your academic path and options for fulfilling your degree as an NYU student.

## User Requirements

- As an NYU student unaware of my degree requirements, I want to ensure I am taking the necessary classes so that I can graduate on time.
- As an NYU student aware of my degree requirements, I want to check that I am taking the necessary pre-requisite classes so that I may take the degree classes I need.
- As an NYU student interested in classes outside of my degree framework, I want to see if I have space in my schedule so that I can explore additional fields.
- As an NYU student reconsidering my major, I want to see what classes I would need to take so that I can switch my major.
- As an NYU student uninterested in any optional courses required in my degree completion, I want to see if there are any substitutions I can make so that I can select a different course and fulfill my degree requirements.
- As an NYU student unsure of what a course entails, I want to get a better understanding of the course details so that I can better prepare myself, and decide when and with whom to take the course.
- As an NYU student trying to schedule classes at proper times, I want an easier way to assess class times so that I can plan my course schedules better.
- As an NYU student frustrated by the Albert system, I want an easier way to view available courses so that I can find classes I need, and am interested easier.
- As an NYU student unsure of prerequsite requirements, I want to see what courses I have to take so that I fulfill prerequisites for other classes.
- As an NYU student deciding between multiple majors, I want to view the degree path for all of them so that I can decide which to take, or if pursuing another major is possible.
