## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder Name

#### Needs
- Students value high professor ratings.
- Students consider the time of course when making a scheduling decision.
- Graduation requirements need to be highlighted better.
- Students want to understand what a course really teaches, and how it is structured before enrolling.

#### Problems
- The interface of the registration system is confusing.
- Course selection is confusing/ tedious and over complicated.
- The registration time slot is inconvenient and difficult to remember.
- Course description is not very descriptive and useful in determining if the course is something they would like to take.

## Product Vision Statement

Build an app to clearly outline your academic path and options for fulfilling your degree as an NYU student.

## User Requirements

- As an NYU student unaware of my degree requirements, I want to ensure I am taking the necessary classes so that I can graduate on time.
- As an NYU student aware of my degree requirements, I want to check that I am taking the necessary pre-requisite classes so that I may take the degree classes I need.
- As an NYU student interested in classes outside of my degree framework, I want to see if I have space in my schedule so that I can explore additional fields.
- As an NYU student reconsidering my major, I want to see what classes I would need to take so that I can switch my major.
- As an NYU student uninterested in any optional courses required in my degree completion, I want to see if there are any substitutions I can make so that I can select a different course and fulfill my degree requirements.
